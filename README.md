## knol-blog ##

* This repository contains the code base for announcing MVB Knoldus winner.

### How does it work ? ###
 
*  We give 30 days (exceptional in case of Feb) period for each post so that makes us announce the winner with a gap of 1 month. 
For example:
   
   If we have to announce winner for Jan, we will announce it on 30th Feb/ 1st March, suppose you write a blog on 3 Jan than 30 days will be on 3 Feb, 
   or someone write blog on 30 Jan 30 days will be on 30 Feb (exceptional but for example, Feb do not have 30th), so we will announce Jan winner in same way.
   
### Criteria to be a winner ###

* The winner will be the one whose post(s) will get the highest number of views in that period of time.
